	--Need to create a sorting tool, prob will use jquery mobile library
	--Sending data chunked via filestreams
	--Look into saving queries into a SessionMember, viewing data and then immediately querying it again seems like a waste. If this could stay in memory for even one state transfer then it could save us a lot of IO time.

	--Figure out the queries

Write tests for the results process and zipping process.

Migrate all views to more descriptive names or folders
