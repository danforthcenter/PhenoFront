#
#	This is a metadata modification file
#
#	The format of this file that of ONE or TWO whitespace separated columns
# 
#	'#' is the comment character, empty lines are ignored
#
#	TO DELETE METADATA:
#		To delete metadata, a line will have one column with only 
#		the identifier string [see: 1]
#
#
#	TO ADD METADATA:
#		To add metadata, a line will have two columns. The first column
#		will be the identifier string [see: 1], the second column will
#		have the metadata.
#		
#		Metadata additions cannot have line breaks in them. They must stay
#		all on the same line.
#
#		If you are editing metadata for snapshots or tiles, this file must include
#		the a row with the first column being "EXPERIMENT_NAME" and the second column
#		being the actual name of the experiment. The experiment can only be set ONCE.
#		More than one EXPERIMENT_NAME lines will throw an error.
#
#		Only snapshots or tiles from a single experiment can be modified per file.
#
#
#	(1): The identifier
#		To indicate whether you wish to modify query, snapshot, or tile metadata,
#		the first column must be of the appropriate form. The form matches this regex:
#				(snapshot|query|tile)#(\\d+)
#
#		Valid Identifiers:
#				query#452
#				tile#23532
#				snapshot#2657
#
#		Invalid Identifiers:
#				queries#6434			'queries' should be 'query'
#				wrongType#4643			'wrongType' is way off
#				query # 3532			no spaces allowed
#				snapshot# 3453			no spaces allowed
#				snapshot #3453			no spaces allowed
#
#
#	Example columns:
#		This column deletes the comment in the query with id = '53352'
#				query#53352
#
#		This column adds the comment 'New comment' to the query with id = '53352'
#				query#53352				New comment
#
#		This column is the same as the previous, the amount of whitespace doesn't matter
#				query#53352	New comment
#
#		This column is invalid because the identifier is malformed
#				query#53352New			comment
#
#		This column is invalid because the identifier is malformed
#				mispelledname#53352		New comment
#
#		This column sets the experiment to 'ExampleExperimentName1'
#				EXPERIMENT_NAME			ExampleExperimentName1
#
#		This column, assuming the EXPERIMENT_NAME is set, deletes any tags on tile with id = '45'
#				tile#45
#
#		This column adds the tag 'This tile is now tagged' to tile with id = '45'
#				tile#45					This tile is now tagged
#
