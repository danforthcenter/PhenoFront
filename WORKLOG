Implemented sessions. Users are now stored in a session as soon as they are logged in. Actions that need
this information must be in the userarea controller.

Selected experiment was also built, and it wires the datasource manually. The information is hardcoded in the
config java file and the experiment name is appended to it.

If it throws a 500 error it means that it still has the user authentication token or whatever but it hasn't loaded the datasource. When this happens a user should be immiately redirect or notified of this event.
